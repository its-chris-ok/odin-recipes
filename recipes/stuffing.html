    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>This cornbread sausage stuffing has tons of savory flavor and an irresistibly moist texture — it will quickly become a tradition at your holiday table.</p>

    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <h4>Main Ingredients</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>1 pound ground pork sausage</li>
        <li>2 cups diced celery</li>
        <li>2 large onions, chopped</li>
        <li>5 cups crumbled cornbread</li>
        <li>5 cups seasoned bread crumbs</li>
        <li>2 ¾ cups chicken broth</li>
    </ul>
    <h4>Seasonings</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>1 & 1/2 teaspoons poultry seasoning</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon dried sage, crushed</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Directions</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat the oven to 325 degrees F (165 degrees C).</li>
        <li>Combine sausage, celery, and onions in a large, deep skillet over medium-high heat. Cook, stirring often and breaking sausage up with a spoon, until sausage is evenly browned and crumbly and vegetables are translucent, 7 to 10 minutes. Remove from the heat and drain.</li>
        <li>Transfer sausage mixture to a large bowl. Add crumbled cornbread, bread crumbs, chicken broth, poultry seasoning, and sage. Mix until well combined, then transfer to a 9x13-inch baking dish. Cover with foil.</li>
        <li>Bake in the preheated oven until stuffing is well set and cooked through, about 45 minutes.</li>
    </ol>
